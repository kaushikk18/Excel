## DASHBOARD FOR CAR SALES IN EXCEL

The objective of this Excel project was to enhance my proficiency in utilizing the spreadsheet software and harnessing Excel's robust features for data cleaning, data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. This project served as a platform to refine my skills in organizing and manipulating data, conducting calculations and analyses, and presenting insights through visually compelling charts and graphs.

The main skills I learned in this project are:
- Data cleaning
- Excel formulas
- Creating Pivit tables
- Visualizing the pivot tables using Charts
- Creating Interactive Dashboard using Slicers

Through data cleaning, duplicate entries were removed, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the dataset. The organization of data, such as categorizing age groups and converting abbreviations into full forms, improved data readability and comprehension.
The use of pivot tables and charts allowed for a comprehensive visual representation of the data, enabling stakeholders to easily understand sales trends, product performance, and customer satisfaction ratings. The sales dashboard provided a centralized view of the data, aiding in quick analysis and identification of important patterns.  

Key Insights:
- Middle Aged people tend to buy more cars.
- The number of bikes they own doesn't affect whether they are buying the car after inquiry.
- People who own a house are buying cars more than people are living in rental properties and the difference is huge.
- If the commute distance is less then they end up buying the car.
